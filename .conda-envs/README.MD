This directory used to contain the per-platform requirements files, listing
the dependencies for DIALS.

That information is now contained in the root `dependencies.yaml` file.

This folder is still used for:

- Listing cctbx dependencies that are not dependencies of DIALS.
- Releases store the pinning lockfiles here.
